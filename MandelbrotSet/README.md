### Mandelbrot Set Java implementation
This project shows how to visualize the Mandelbrot set, defined by the formula:

The program uses parallel processes (threads) to distribute the work for the search of all points of the Mandelbrot set on more than one processor. The program also generates an image (for example, .png), which shows the number found.
