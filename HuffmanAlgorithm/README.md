### Huffman's Algorithm C++ implementation
Huffman's algorithm implemented here is a relatively simple, universal data compression algorithm without loss of data. It is assumed that a initial stream of symbols is given at a predetermined interval. We will assume that these are symbols encoded with an ASCII code, so we will look at the information as a sequence of bytes (numbers in range 0..255). The algorithm is based on the simple idea that the most common symbols in the sequence should be recorded with the smallest number of bits. This algorithm builds a new alphabet that follows this idea and then translates the initial information into the new alphabet, so the final information is encoded with that new alphabet. The encoding is reversible, so the encoded sequence can be decoded to the initial sequence of symbols.
